# Config File Schema Changelog

This file tracks the changes made to the config.yaml file format over time. Some
changes do not require the schema to be incrmented, while others do. This will
also be noted in the log.

When you update, you should review changes that occured between your current
version and the new version. While migration will occur automatically for many
changes, it does not mean there aren't new features or options you may want to
take advantage of.
