# LeGo Certhub
LeGo Certhub is being designed to function as a centralized management
solution for Let's Encrypt certificates.

This is a personal side project of mine that I plan to use in my home
production environment once complete.

## Frontend
This repo is the frontend for the application which is built in GoLang.
